## Overview

This is an example of [LSA](https://github.com/Skycker/lsa) made with Flask

Result of my search engine implementation is compared with Sphinx search engine.

1. clone this repo, install requirements into virtualenv (from repo and submodule)
2. fill example DB
3. install Sphinx and make index
4. make index with lsa implementation
5. run flask app, visit web page and do search

I'll make a normal doc, I promise
